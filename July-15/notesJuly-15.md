> Inline elements

1. does not care about height and width,
2. side by side

> block-level elements

1. respect height and width
2. stacked

> Inline block

1. respect height and width
2. side by side

- for flex width is just a suggestion
- overflow
- background-blend-mode
- semantic elements(main,header,footer,aside,section,article,etc..,)
- (!important) in html it is called specificity -> whenever there are clash of styles, which will get the high priority
- !important > inline > id > class > element > inherited
