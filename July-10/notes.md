- shallow copy creates copy by reference for nested arrays or objects
- deep copy creates a new memory for the array or objects

> Imperative vs Declarative

- functional programming encourages declarative coding
- method shorthand

```js
{
    name : "Afrin"
    petname(){return 'summi'}} // method shorthand
{
    name : "Afrin"
    petname : function(){return 'summi'}}
```

- paradigm -> computer styles (object oriented, procedural oriented, mathematical oriented)

- what is currying, example, how to use in real life && partial application && what is point free coding -> assignment
